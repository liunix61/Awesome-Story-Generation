## Introduction
This project collects an extensive list of remarkable papers on **Story Generation**, primarily focusing on the era of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

We would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to [**Awesome-story-generation**](https://github.com/Whorra/Awesome-story-generation),  [**PaperForONLG**](https://github.com/thu-coai/PaperForONLG/tree/main) and [**GPT-Academic**](https://github.com/binary-husky/gpt_academic/) for their invaluable assistance and contributions.

The <🔥> denotes the latest research work. And <🀄> signifies that we have provided a **Chinese translation** of the paper (translations are completed by the **GPT-Academic** open-source project, and all copyrights belong to the original authors). [**Project GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/binary-husky/gpt_academic/). [**Project Online Experience**](https://chatpaper.org)

Please note that the citations are up-to-date as of our last discovery of the papers, but they may not be revised in the future. This is intended to serve as a reference to help you gauge the impact of each paper.
